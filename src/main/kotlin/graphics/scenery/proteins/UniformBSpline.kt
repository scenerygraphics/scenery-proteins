/**
 * This class generates a smooth curve within the convex hull of the control points. Note that the spline
 * does not necessarily pass through the control points. If you need a curve, which actually contains the
 * control points, use the Catmull Rom Spline instead. However, if this is not required and you prefer a
 * smoother curve over the exact one, this is the spline to draw.
 * The control points are represented by a List of Vectors ([controlPoints]) and the number of points the
 * curve shall contain is [n], which is the hundred times the number of controlPoints by default.
 * The following code calculates firstly equidistant parameters for the curve calculation (the t in C(t)). Then we
 * calculate the curve segment by segment with four points each. The maths of uniform B-Splines are described, for
 * example, in: "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice, Third Edition" by James D. Foley et al.
